<summary>🤔 Why this name?</summary>

```rust
use std::ops::BitOr;

struct S(&'static str);

impl BitOr for S {
    type Output = String;
    fn bitor(self, rhs: Self) -> Self::Output {
        format!("{} in {}!", self.0, rhs.0)
    }
}

fn main() {
    println!("{}", S("sum") | S("world"));
}
```

*Sometimes the answer is in the code itself* ✨

### 🔒 Security Research & Exploits

- **Linux Kernel CVE-2022-32250 Exploit Development** — WHS-2 (White Hat School), Team Project (2024)
  - Implemented a Linux kernel exploit for CVE-2022-32250 (UAF) with:
    - Heap grooming & leakage primitives
    - KASLR-related exploitation steps
    - Privilege escalation technique via `modprobe_path` overwrite (controlled execution path)

- **SKT USIM Hacking Analysis** — USIS (University Student Intelligence Society), 3rd Cohort (2025, Team Project)
  - Wrote a readability-first technical report for a mixed-background team (many non-CS members)
  - Focus: USIM/telecom threat surface, core flows around subscriber identity, and security implications across telecom backend components (e.g., HSS/UDM) from an APT-style perspective
  - Role: Primary author of the report, organizing the narrative, diagrams, and explanations to make complex topics digestible
 
- **OpenStack “Open the Window” Security Auditing** — SSL 6th Term (Oct 2025 – Jan 2026)
  - Authored a detailed report on the **Barbican Key Management** module, including architecture analysis and threat modelling.
  - Presented the team’s vulnerability findings (DOM XSS, IDOR, SSRF) in the final briefing, ensuring accurate reproduction and impact analysis.
  - Worked across Skyline‑Console, Cinder, Glance, and Barbican to verify issues and document mitigation steps.

### 🧠 Machine Learning

- **ML‑based Flood Prediction (Han River)** — Hydrology / ML Coursework Project (2024)  
  - Proposed the project topic and led the effort to build an LSTM‑based time‑series model for predicting Han River water levels using real‑world data.  
  - Focused on rigorous evaluation, feature engineering, and iterative model improvement.  
  - This research concept later inspired the Social Crab hardware project in the BitCrab embedded systems club.

### ⚙️ Hardware

- **Social Crab PCB Design** — BitCrab Embedded Systems Club (Yonsei University) / 2024 IHEI Workstation Social Innovation Project (2024, Team Project)
  - As part of a small team from BitCrab, executed this hardware project inspired by our flood-prediction coursework, applying data-driven insights to embedded design for social impact (e.g., flood monitoring IoT prototype).
  - Designed a custom PCB for Raspberry Pi Pico, focusing on power-stability testing and embedded prototyping with protocols like I2C/SPI/UART.
  - Contributed to bring-up/testing workflows and documented processes for reproducible results.
